# OpenAI Pilot (My first interaction with their API)

This is a simple project to test the OpenAI API. The idea is to create a simple chatbot that can answer questions about the OpenAI API. Also there is a simple function that can generate a picture based on a prompt.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Narkobaron15/openai-pilot.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Run the project

```bash
node --env-file=.env main.js
```
